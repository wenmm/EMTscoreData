\title{EMTscoreData: Single-cell RNA-seq datasets for EMTscore}
\format{
SingleCellExperiment object containing scRNA-seq profiles for
cell line and treatment.
}
\description{
The EMTscoreData package provides 12 single-cell RNA-seq datasets from
Cook DP, Vanderhyden BC (2020). Context specificity of the EMT
transcriptional response. Nature Communications 11(1):2142.
}
\details{
These datasets profile epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in multiple
human cancer cell lines (MCF7, OVCA420, DU145, A549) treated with TNF,
TGFb1,EGF.

Each dataset was processed into a SingleCellExperiment object and saved as
an .rda file.

The datasets can be accessed via \code{ExperimentHub} using the provided
accessors. Each object contains gene expression matrices and associated
cell metadata, such as treatment.
}
\examples{
library(ExperimentHub)
eh <- ExperimentHub()
query(eh, "EMTscoreData") 

#Example: load MCF7 TGFb1 dataset
mcf7_tgfb1 <- eh[["EH10284"]]
