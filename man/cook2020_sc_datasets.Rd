\title{Single-cell RNA-seq EMT datasets from Cook & Vanderhyden (2020)}
\format{
Seurat objects containing scRNA-seq profiles for specific
cell line × treatment combinations.
}
\description{
This dataset collection contains single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiles of
human epithelial cancer cell lines (MCF7, OVCA420, DU145, and A549) treated
with EMT-inducing factors: TNF, EGF, or TGFB1.
}
\details{
Each dataset was processed into a Seurat object and saved as an .rds file.
These data were generated and described in Cook & Vanderhyden (2020).

The datasets can be accessed via \code{ExperimentHub} using the provided accessors.
Each object contains gene expression matrices and associated cell metadata,
such as cell type, condition, and treatment.
}
\examples{
library(ExperimentHub)
eh <- ExperimentHub()
query(eh, "EMTscoreData")

# Example: load MCF7 TGFB1 dataset
mcf7_tgfb1 <- EMTscoreData::cook2020_sc_MCF7_TGFB1()
